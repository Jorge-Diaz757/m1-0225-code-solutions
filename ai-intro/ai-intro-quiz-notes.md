## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  // My answer:
  I don't think AI will replace developers but instead can change the role of developers or create new opportunities like working and improving ai

          Ai answer:

  No, AI will assist but not replace software developers entirely. It automates repetitive tasks, but creativity, problem-solving, and complex system design still require human expertise.

          My observation:

  Ai gave more details and a better explanation on how ai will not replace web developers and how this is actually going to benefit them.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  // My answer:
  The best way to use ai tools while learning software development is to explain or answer a question we might have

          Ai answer:

  Use AI tools as coding assistants for debugging, explanations, and code suggestions. Focus on understanding concepts rather than just copying solutions.

          My observation:

  While I only think one short answer trying to summarize everything. Ai gave a lot of details and also a whole list of the best ways to use this tool.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  // My answer:  
  using Ai to create our code for us is a big mistake because we will not be learning nor understanding anything and will never be able to independently create our own code and that will cause a lot of future problems when trying to find a job

          Ai answer:

  Over-reliance on AI can hinder problem-solving skills and deeper understanding. Always analyze AI-generated code and try to solve problems on your own first.

          My Observation:

  Same as the second question, Ai print a whole list of how to NOT use Ai while learning how to code.
