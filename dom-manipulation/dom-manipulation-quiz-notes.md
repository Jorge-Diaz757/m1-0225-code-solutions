## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
<!-- The className property of an element object gets or sets the value of the element’s class attribute as a string. It’s used to change or read the CSS classes applied to that element. -->
- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?
<!--You can update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript by setting its className  -->
- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?
<!-- The textContent property gets or sets the text inside an element, ignoring any HTML tags. -->
- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
<!-- You can update the text within an element using JavaScript by setting its textContent property -->
- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
<!-- No, the event parameter isn't always useful—it’s only needed if you want to access information about the event, like the target element or mouse position. -->
- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
<!-- It would be more complicated without a variable, because you'd need to find another way to track the count, like parsing text from the DOM, which is less efficient and harder to manage. -->
- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
<!-- Storing information in variables is better because it's faster, easier to manage, and keeps the program logic separate from the presentation (DOM), making the code cleaner and more efficient. -->
