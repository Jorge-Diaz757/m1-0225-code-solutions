- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?

- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?
  // This happens due to inheritance and the cascade in CSS

- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity.
  // p, div, h1
- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice?
